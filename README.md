AVR simulator made in Rust and C++

Core library is in Rust and will expose an API for GUI in C++ (QT).

This simulator aims to be suited for performance analysis.

# Building from sources

From a terminal, you can clone the repo with 

~~~
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mlafroce/avr-avogadro.git
~~~

This will download [QHexEdit2](https://github.com/Simsys/qhexedit2/) as a dependency.

If you choose "Download as a zip", copy QHexEdit2 sources into `qt-gui/3rd-party/qhexedit2`


## Dependencies

Currently only linux target is supported.  To build from sources you need

* Rust toolchain (includes *rustc* and *cargo*)

* GCC toolchain  (*g++* needed for GUI)

* CMake (>= 3.9) (Cargo build instructions use *cmake* to build GUI)

To get Rust last version, download Rust compiler following instructions on their [site](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Install *GCC* and *Qt5* with the following commands

~~~
sudo apt install build-essential cmake qt5-default
~~~

## Build

Compile with `cargo build` Rust's package manager will download and build dependencies.

Run `cargo run` to run the application.

## Tests and linter

Run `cargo test` to build and run *unit tests*.

*Clippy* is used as Rust linter. Install and run with

~~~
rustup component add clippy
cargo clippy
~~~

## Examples

Small avr examples are in `examples` folder.

You can compile them running `make` or manually using `avr-gcc`.

Install with

~~~
sudo apt install gcc-avr
~~~
